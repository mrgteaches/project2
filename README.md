The Learning Lizard

Our app is a learning tool which takes in pairs of data, such as words and definitions or other facts, which the user would like to memorize. 
The app then allows the user to practice/drill the information using one of three modes: flashcards, a hangman game, or a multiple-choice quiz.
The app uses express.js, node.js, MySQL and Sequelize on the backend. The hangman and quiz modes are set up but not yet completely functional.
